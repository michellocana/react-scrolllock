# React Scroll Lock

*ðŸš¨ Not Maintained*
[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

This project is a fork of [react-scrolllock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scrolllock), which is now unmantained. This version keeps all of the original code, but updates the `react` and `react-dom` peer dependencies and moves from Flow to TypeScript.

Prevent scroll on the `<body />` when a component is mounted.

## Install

```bash
yarn add react-scrolllock
```

## Usage

```js
import ScrollLock, { TouchScrollable } from 'react-scrolllock';

class Modal extends Component {
  state = { lockScroll: false };
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        ... // the lock accepts a single child element, which supports
        touch-scrolling.
        <ScrollLock>
          <ElementWithScrollableContent>...</ElementWithScrollableContent>
        </ScrollLock>
        // if your app structure doesn't allow wrapping like above, the
        `TouchScrollable` // component is exposed as a named export.
        <ScrollLock />
        <TouchScrollable>
          <ElementWithScrollableContent>...</ElementWithScrollableContent>
        </TouchScrollable>
        // you can also toggle the lock based on some state.
        <ScrollLock isActive={this.state.lockScroll} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Props

#### ScrollLock

| Property                       | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| accountForScrollbars `boolean` | Default: `true` -- Whether or not to replace the scrollbar width when active.           |
| isActive `boolean`             | Default: `true` -- Whether or not the lock is active.                                   |
| children `element`             | Default: `null` -- This element is wrapped internally by the TouchScrollable component. |

#### TouchScrollable

Wrap an element in the `TouchScrollable` component if you need an area that supports scroll on mobile.

This is necessary because the `touchmove` event is explicitly cancelled &mdash; iOS doesn't observe `overflow: hidden;` when applied to the `<body />` element ðŸ˜¢
